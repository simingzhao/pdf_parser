# Project Instructions

Use specification and guidelines as you build the app.

Write the complete code for every step. Do not get lazy.

Your goal is to completely finish whatever I ask for.

You will see  tags in the code. These are context tags that you should use to help you understand the codebase.


## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn, Framer Motion

## Rules

Follow these rules when building the app.

### General Rules

- All files should have a comment at the very top of the file that consisely explain what it does
